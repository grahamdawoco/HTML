        <h2>Student at Wofford College Class of 2019</h2>
        <h2>Bachelor in Economics and Computer Science</h2>
        <p>I declared my majors sophomore year, went with a minor in math this past year because my GPA was just too high.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the plan worked.</p>
        <p>I'm currently employed with Chegg as a tutor; have completed an internship with Victims of Communism in DC.
            During my time there, I was fortunate to learn quite a bit.

                What's expected of a technical intern is significantly different from what I thought was expected of a technical intern.
